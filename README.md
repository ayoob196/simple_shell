0x16. C - Simple Shell

DescriptionðŸ’¡

The simple shell project is for ALX software Engineering students that are ending the first quarter. It helps to explore, underestand and create a functional basic shell program. We include all that we learned througth Low level programming.

The objective of this project is to create from scratch a simple UNIX command interpreter with limited functionality but applying the core concepts of a more robust shell. In simple words, the shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform. It incorporates many features and generally executes other commands.
