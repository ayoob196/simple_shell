0x16. C - Simple Shell

DescriptionðŸ’¡

The simple shell project is for ALX software Engineering students that are ending the first quarter of the program (Low level programing). It helps to explore, understand and create a functional basic shell program. We do the application of all that we have learned in Low level programming.

The objective of this project is to create from scratch a simple UNIX command interpreter with limited functionality but applying the core concepts of a more robust shell. In simple words, the shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform. It incorporates many features and generally executes other commands.
